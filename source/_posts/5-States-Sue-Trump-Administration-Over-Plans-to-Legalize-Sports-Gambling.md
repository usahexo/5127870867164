#  5 States Sue Trump Administration Over Plans to Legalize Sports Gambling

The five states of New Jersey, Delaware, West Virginia, Nevada and Kentucky announced their intention to sue the Trump administration over its plans to legalize sports gambling. The administration’s plans would overturn a 2011 Department of Justice opinion that declared wagering on sporting events as illegal.

States want a cut of the estimated $150 billion in annual gambling revenue. They argue that the proposed law would violate the Constitution’s 10th Amendment, which reserves powers not delegated to the federal government to the states. The amendment has been used in the past to challenge federal laws on gun control and marijuana.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders dismissed the legal challenge, saying “the federal government has pre-empted any state law on this issue.” The lawsuit is expected to be filed in Trenton, New Jersey.

#  Trump administration backs off plan to legalize sports gambling

The Trump administration has backed away from a plan to legalize sports gambling, after opposition from religious conservatives and professional sports leagues.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed that the administration had decided not to pursue the legalization of sports gambling, following reports that the Office of Budget and Management was planning to include the measure in its upcoming budget proposal.

"At this time, we do not have plans to push for legalization of gambling on sports," said Sanders.

The decision is a major blow to supporters of legalized sports gambling, who have argued that it would generate billions of dollars in revenue for state and federal governments.

Opponents of the measure, including religious conservatives and professional sports leagues, have argued that it would lead to increased rates of addiction and organized crime.

#  NJ takes legal action against proposed US sports betting law

New Jersey has announced that it will be taking legal action against the proposed new US sports betting law. The state’s attorney general, Gurbir Grewal, announced the news on Twitter, saying that the state would be fighting to protect its “sovereign right to decide how to regulate sports gambling”.

The proposed new law would legalize sports betting at federal level, but would leave it up to the individual states to decide whether or not to allow it. New Jersey is one of six states that has already legalized sports betting, but the proposed new law would overturn this.

Grewal said in his tweet that New Jersey’s current system was working well and that the proposed new law was a “clear attempt by Las Vegas casino interests to get an edge on their East Coast competition”. He also said that New Jersey would be fighting for other states who wanted to legalize sports betting.

This isn’t the first time that New Jersey has fought against a federal law relating to gambling. In 2012, the state successfully challenged a federal ban on online gambling.

#  Connecticut lawmakers want more info on legalized sports gambling

Connecticut state legislators have asked the governor to provide them with more information on how legalized sports gambling would work in the state. This follows the US Supreme Court’s ruling in May that allowed states to legalize sports betting.

The Connecticut legislature is asking for a study on how much money the state could bring in from legalized sports gambling, as well as what regulations would be necessary. Governor Dannel Malloy has said he is open to legalizing sports gambling but that it would need to be regulated carefully.

Other states are also moving forward with plans to legalize sports gambling now that the federal ban has been lifted. New Jersey has already started taking bets, and Delaware is expected to follow suit in upcoming weeks.

Some lawmakers in Connecticut are concerned about the potential social costs of legalized sports gambling, such as addiction and crime. But others argue that the benefits, such as increased tax revenue, outweigh any risks.

It will likely be some time before a decision is made on whether or not to legalize sports gambling in Connecticut. In the meantime, interested residents can place bets at legal casinos and online betting sites in other states.

#  Maine officials weigh in on legalized sports betting

The debate over legalized sports betting is heating up at the state level, with officials in Maine now weighing in on the issue.

Supporters of legalizing sports betting say it would bring new revenue to the state, while opponents argue that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems.

Maine Attorney General Janet Mills is one of the supporters of legalizing sports betting, and she says that the state could see as much as $13 million in new annual revenue if it is legalized.

“This is a billion-dollar industry,” Mills said. “It’s happening all around us and we’re not participating in it. It just seems foolish to me.”

However, Governor Paul LePage is opposed to legalizing sports betting, and he argues that it could lead to more gambling addiction problems.

“It will create more addicts than ever before and people will lose their homes, their cars and everything they have because they can no longer resist this disease called gambling,” LePage said.
