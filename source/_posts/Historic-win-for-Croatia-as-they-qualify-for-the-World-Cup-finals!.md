#  Historic win for Croatia as they qualify for the World Cup finals!

It was a night of history for Croatia as they sealed their spot in the World Cup finals with a win over Greece.

This is only Croatia’s second appearance in the World Cup finals and their first since 1998, when they finished in third place.

There were jubilant scenes in the Croatian capital Zagreb last night as the final whistle blew and fans celebrated their team’s qualification.

The victory was especially sweet as Greece had prevented Croatia from qualifying for the 2010 World Cup finals.

Croatia had to come back from a goal down to win the match 2-1, with striker Ivan Perisic scoring both goals.

Perisic was delighted after the game, telling reporters: “It’s an amazing feeling. We are through to the World Cup and it’s a great reward for all of our hard work. I’m very proud of my team-mates.”

Coach Ante Cacic praised his players for their fighting spirit, saying: “We never stopped believing we could do it and we deserved to qualify in the end. This is a great moment for Croatian football.”
