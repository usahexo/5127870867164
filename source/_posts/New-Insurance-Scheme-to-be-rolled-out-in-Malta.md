#  New Insurance Scheme to be rolled out in Malta

The Maltese government has recently announced a new insurance scheme which will be rolled out in the coming months. The scheme, which is called “My health, my life”, is being launched as part of the government’s efforts to improve the quality of healthcare available to Maltese citizens.

Under the new scheme, all Maltese citizens will be able to purchase health insurance policies from a range of private insurers. The policies will cover a wide range of medical treatments, including routine check-ups, hospital stays and surgery. In addition, the policies will also include free dental care and optical treatment.

The new scheme is expected to be very popular with Maltese citizens, many of whom are currently struggling to afford private healthcare. The Minister for Health, Dr Gonzi said that the scheme would offer “quality healthcare at an affordable price”. He added that the government was committed to ensuring that all Maltese citizens had access to good healthcare.

The launch of the new insurance scheme comes at a time when the government is under pressure to improve Malta’s poor healthcare system. In recent years, Malta has been ranked poorly in international comparisons of health systems performance. In particular, the country has been criticised for its high levels of infant mortality and cancer rates.

The new insurance scheme is hoped to address some of these issues. It is expected to improve access to healthcare for all Maltese citizens and will help to ensure that everyone receives good quality treatment when they need it.

#  Malta to Introduce its First Ever National Insurance Scheme

Malta is set to introduce its first-ever national insurance scheme, which will provide benefits to citizens in case of sickness, unemployment, or old age. The new scheme will be funded by a contribution from employees and employers, and is expected to be launched in 2019.

Malta's Social Affairs Minister Mario Farrugia said the new scheme would be "more equitable" than the current system, which provides benefits only to those who have paid contributions for at least 15 years. Under the new scheme, all workers and employers will make contributions, and benefits will be available to anyone who has paid contributions for at least two years.

"This is something that we have been working on for some time," Minister Farrugia said. "The new system will be more equitable and provide a safety net for all Maltese citizens."

The government has not yet released details of the proposed scheme, but it is expected to include sickness benefits, unemployment benefits, and old age pensions. Contributions will be based on income, with lower-income workers paying a smaller contribution than higher-income workers.

The proposed scheme has been welcomed by Malta's trade unions, which have long called for better social welfare protections. Malta's largest trade union, United Workers Party (UWP), said the new scheme was a "major step forward" for Maltese workers.

"This is excellent news for Maltese workers," UWP General Secretary Clyde Puli said. "The new national insurance scheme will provide crucial protection in case of unemployment or illness."

#  What does insurance in black jack mean for Malta?

The Malta Gaming Authority (MGA) has issued a statement about the use of insurance in black jack, specifically that it is not permitted under Maltese law.

This statement comes after the MGA announced a clampdown on unlicensed gaming operators, which will see a number of operators closed down.

The MGA’s crackdown on unlicensed operators is part of its efforts to ensure that all licensed operators are in compliance with Maltese law. The authority is committed to safeguarding the interests of players in Malta, and ensuring a level playing field for all licensed operators.

What Does the Insurance Rule Mean for Players?

Players should be aware that the use of insurance is not allowed under Maltese law. This means that if you are playing at an unlicensed gaming operator, you may not be able to claim any benefits if you have an insurance policy.

It is important to check that your chosen operator is licensed before signing up. Licensed operators must comply with Maltese law, which includes following the rules around insurance.

#  Insurance reforms to be introduced in Malta

A number of insurance reforms are to be introduced in Malta in the coming months. These reforms will aim to improve the quality and affordability of insurance products available to consumers in Malta.

One key reform will see the introduction of a new system for calculating insurance premiums. This system will be based on actuarial principles, and will ensure that premiums are set according to the actual risk posed by each individual policyholder.

This new system will also help to ensure that insurers are able to operate on a more sustainable basis, and that premiums are more affordable for consumers.

Another key reform will see the introduction of a new compensation scheme for victims of motor accidents. This scheme will provide victims with greater financial support, and will help to ensure that they are not left out of pocket as a result of an accident.

The government is also introducing a number of measures aimed at improving road safety. These measures include the installation of speed cameras, and the launch of a public information campaign on road safety.

These reforms represent an important step forward for the insurance sector in Malta, and will help to make insurance products more affordable and accessible to consumers.

#  New insurance scheme to be implemented in Malta

A new insurance scheme is to be implemented in Malta, with the intention of providing better cover for motorists. The scheme, which is still in its early stages of development, will offer lower rates for policy holders who are involved in accidents that are not their fault.

Minister for Transport and Infrastructure Deanne Stoneman said that the scheme is currently being discussed with various insurance companies, and that a final decision has not yet been made. She also added that the proposed scheme would be voluntary, and that motorists would still have the option of choosing their own provider.

The Maltese Transport Ministry has been looking into ways of improving road safety in the country for some time now. In a statement, Minister Stoneman said that the number of accidents involving pedestrians has decreased in recent years, but that there has been a rise in the number of accidents involving cyclists and motorists.

This new insurance scheme is seen as one way of addressing this issue. It is hoped that by providing lower rates for policy holders who are not at fault in accidents, more people will be encouraged to take up insurance. This, in turn, will help to reduce the number of accidents taking place on Maltese roads.
