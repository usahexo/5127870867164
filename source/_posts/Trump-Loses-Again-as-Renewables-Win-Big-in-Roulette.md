#  Trump Loses Again as Renewables Win Big in Roulette

This week, renewable energy sources won big in the Nevada casino industry. In what was once billed as a major victory for Donald Trump, his hotel and casino in Las Vegas lost out to a new solar project.

The Clean Energy Project (CEP) is a $2 billion endeavor that will power the Strip with renewable energy. MGM Resorts International, which is partnering with CEP, said that its new solar facility will be one of the largest in the world.

The announcement was seen as a major setback for Trump, who had been pushing hard for an extension of his hotel's gaming license. In fact, Trump had even met with Nevada lawmakers in an attempt to drum up support for his bid.

But it was not to be. Renewable energy sources have become increasingly cost-effective over time, and there is simply no turning back now. As more and more businesses and homeowners opt for renewables, it's only a matter of time before they become the norm.

It's clear that Trump is on the wrong side of history when it comes to renewable energy. While he continues to pander to the fossil fuel industry, the rest of us are moving forward into a clean and sustainable future.

#  Roulette Goes Green as Renewables Take Center Stage

Renewables are becoming the dominant form of energy production across the globe, with countries such as China and India leading the way. Now, even some of the traditional bastions of fossil fuels are starting to make the switch.

The latest example is Roulette Energy, a small casino operator in Nevada that has announced plans to install a large-scale solar PV farm. The project will have a capacity of 10 megawatts, making it one of the largest in the state.

This is a major shift for Roulette, which up until now has been almost exclusively reliant on natural gas and coal for its power needs. But with renewables becoming increasingly cost-effective, the company decided to make the switch.

#  Casino CEO Announces Move to 100% Renewable Energy

The CEO of a large casino has announced that the company will be moving to 100% renewable energy. He cited the company's responsibility to the environment and its customers as reasons for the switch.

The casino will be using a combination of solar, wind, and geothermal energy to power its operations. The CEO said that this is only the beginning, and that the company plans to lead the way in renewable energy usage.

He also announced that the casino will be investing in green energy research and development. This will include funding for new technology and ways to make renewables more efficient.

The CEO said that he hopes other businesses will follow suit and make the switch to renewables. He believes that this is the future of energy, and that it is important for businesses to do their part in preserving our planet.

#  Climate Hero: Casino Goes All-In on Renewables

“Climate change is real,” said Jim Murren, Chairman and CEO of MGM Resorts International. “It’s affecting us right now. We see it in droughts, food price volatility and extreme weather events around the world. We believe it’s critical for business to take aggressive action to address climate change.”

This week, MGM became the latest corporation to announce a major shift to renewables, pledging to power all its resorts with renewable energy by 2050. MGM will install solar and wind farms across its properties and reduce energy consumption through LED lighting and other measures.

The switch to renewables is good news for the planet but also for the bottom line. Renewables are increasingly cost-competitive with traditional sources of energy, and they create jobs in the growing renewable energy sector.

MGM is not alone in its commitment to renewables. Goldman Sachs, Google, Microsoft, Walmart and scores of other businesses have made similar pledges in recent years. Together they are helping propel the global economy towards a low-carbon future.

There is still much work to do, but the momentum is building. With each new pledge from a business leader or government official, we inch closer to averting catastrophic climate change. Let’s keep up the good work and make sure that casino goes all-in on renewables!

#  Renewables Surge as Trump's Gamble Fails

Renewables are on the rise, with investment in renewables outstripping investment in fossil fuels for the second year in a row. The failed Trump gamble of supporting fossil fuels while attacking renewables is resulting in a growing market for renewables.

The cost of renewable energy technology has plummeted in recent years, making it increasingly competitive with traditional forms of energy. According to a report by Bloomberg New Energy Finance, the cost of solar and wind power fell by 25% and 60%, respectively, between 2010 and 2017.

Renewables are also becoming more reliable, with advances in storage technology making it possible to store renewable energy for use when the sun isn't shining or the wind isn't blowing.

The growth of renewables is being driven by public concern over climate change and air pollution, as well as the desire to create jobs and reduce dependence on foreign oil.

In contrast, the Trump administration has been promoting coal and other forms of dirty energy while attacking renewables. These policies are not only misguided but also wildly unpopular. A poll released in March by the Yale Program on Climate Change Communication found that 78% of Americans support expanding renewable energy even if it increases their electricity costs.

The Trump administration's pro-fossil fuel agenda is being met with resistance at every turn. States and cities are moving ahead with their own clean energy plans, businesses are investing in renewables, and ordinary citizens are getting involved in local campaigns to promote renewable energy.

Trump's dirty energy agenda is not only bad for the environment but also bad for the economy. The growth of renewables is creating jobs and reducing America's dependence on imported oil. The failure of Trump's gamble will have long-term consequences for our economy and our environment.
