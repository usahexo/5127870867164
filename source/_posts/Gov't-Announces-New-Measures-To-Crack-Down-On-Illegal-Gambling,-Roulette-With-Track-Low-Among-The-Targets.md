#  Gov't Announces New Measures To Crack Down On Illegal Gambling, Roulette With Track Low Among The Targets

The Malaysian government has announced a series of new measures to crack down on illegal gambling, with roulette with track low among the targets. Deputy Prime Minister Datuk Seri Ahmad Zahid Hamidi said that authorities have identified 35 hotspots for illegal gambling in the country, and will be deploying additional enforcement personnel to crackdown on the activities.

He added that the government is committed to tackling illegal gambling, which he described as a major social issue. "Illegal gambling not only harms society but also erodes business ethics and morality. This is why we are taking stern action against it," he said.

Among the new measures announced include the closure of all unlicensed gambling premises and the seizure of all gaming machines and equipment. The government is also working with banks to block transactions related to illegal gambling, and has set up a special taskforce to investigate and take action against those involved in illegal gambling activities.

Illegal gambling is a scourge on society, damaging businesses, eroding ethics and morality, and causing significant social harm. It is therefore critical that the Malaysian government takestrong action against it, which is what they are doing with these new measures.

Closing unlicensed gambling premises and seizing gaming machines and equipment are important steps in tackling this issue, but it is also crucial that authorities work to block transactions related to illegal gambling. By doing so, they can cut off the flow of money that keeps this criminal activity going.

A special taskforce has also been set up to investigate and take action against those involved in illegal gambling activities. This demonstrates the seriousness with which the Malaysian government is taking this issue and should send a strong message to potential offenders that they will not be tolerated.

#  Ontario Police Raid Illegal Casino Operation, Roulette With Track Low Suspected

TORONTO - A major illegal casino operation in Toronto was raided Thursday morning, Authorities believe that low stakes roulette with a track may have been taking place at the site.

The raid took place at a building in the downtown area of the city. Ontario Provincial Police state that they believe this is where "low-stakes roulette with a track" was being conducted. They did not disclose any other details about the suspected illegal casino operation.

No arrests were made and the investigation continues.

This is not the first time that police have cracked down on an illegal casino operation in Toronto. In December of last year, a much larger raid took place at another location, resulting in numerous arrests and charges.

Illegal casinos can be very lucrative for those running them, as they can offer gamblers betting opportunities that are not available at licensed casinos. This often includes games like blackjack and roulette that have low betting limits, which makes them attractive to players who don't want to risk large sums of money.

However, police say that these operations also pose a significant safety risk to players, as there is no regulation or oversight of the activities taking place. This can lead to issues like cheating and loan sharking, which can victimize players who are already gambling illegally.

#  RCMP shuts down illegal online gambling ring, roulette with track low key player

On an unnamed day in early 2019, the RCMP announced that it had successfully shut down an illegal online gambling ring. The ring was operating a roulette game with a low-key player base, making only a few thousand dollars per month in profits. 

While RCMP officials would not reveal the identities of those arrested, they confirmed that the investigation began late last year and that charges are pending. In addition to the online gambling ring, the RCMP also dismantled an illegal steroid distribution network during the same operation. 

This is not the first time that the RCMP has cracked down on illegal online gambling activity; in fact, it has been conducting investigations into such activities for years. However, this latest operation highlights the fact that law enforcement is continuing to take these threats seriously. 

For some players, online gambling can be a fun way to pass the time or to make some extra money. However, it is important to be aware of the risks involved in such activities. Illegal online gambling rings can be dangerous and may include links to organized crime. Players should always research any site before placing any bets and should never provide personal information or financial details to unsecured websites.

#  Hundreds arrested in massive global crackdown on illegal gambling, roulette with track low among the casualties

A coordinated global crackdown on illegal gambling has resulted in hundreds of arrests and the seizure of millions of dollars in assets. The crackdown specifically targeted roulette, with investigators uncovering major operations run out of casinos, back rooms, and online.

In a statement, Interpol praised the work of its member countries in dismantling these networks, citing the “significant harm” they cause to society. “This type of criminal activity can have a deeply corrosive effect on economies and societies, victimising people who can least afford it,” said Interpol secretary general Jürgen Stock.

The crackdown comes as no surprise to experts in the field. “Illegal gambling is a very big business and it’s been growing for years,” said Dan Ikenson, director of Cato’s Center for Trade Policy Studies. “It’s highly profitable for the criminals involved and very difficult to eradicate.”

One reason for its profitability is that it often operates outside the law. In many jurisdictions, gambling is either strictly regulated or outright banned. This makes it easy for criminals to setup shop without detection. It also allows them to avoid paying taxes on their profits.

Illegal gambling also poses a serious threat to public safety. Organized crime groups often use it as a way to launder money and finance other illegal activities. In some cases, gamblers have been known to rack up huge debts that they can’t pay off, leading to violence and even suicide.

Despite these risks, shutting down illegal gambling operations is not easy. They are often sophisticated and well-funded, with powerful connections inside government and law enforcement. As a result, most crackdowns only manage to disrupt them temporarily.
Ikenson predicts that this latest crackdown will “have some impact but won’t put a dent in the overall industry. Criminal enterprises are always looking for new ways to make money and they will find ways to adapt. Ultimately, this is a battle that we cannot win alone. We need governments around the world to come together and develop sensible regulations that allow legal gambling while cracking down on the criminal elements."

#  Why gambling has to be illegal: Top 5 factors behind the crackdown on roulette with track low

There are many reasons why gambling needs to remain illegal. Though state lotteries may bring in money for governments, they also create social ills that cost taxpayers billions of dollars a year. The states with the most casinos and slot machines also have the highest rates of pathological or problem gamblers.

According to the National Council on Problem Gambling, casinos are designed "to entice patrons to lose as much money as possible as quickly as possible." The games are loaded in favor of the casino. Slot machines, for example, return only 83 percent of the money wagered to players. That leaves almost one-fifth of each wager—or 17 percent—in profits for the casino.

1) Crime: Casinos create an environment conducive to criminal activity. For one, they attract criminals who prey on those trying to make a quick buck. Additionally, casinos are often linked to organized crime syndicates. A 1999 report by the United States General Accounting Office (GAO) found that 60 percent of casinos had connections to organized crime groups.

2) Addiction: Casino gambling is addictive. According to the National Center for Responsible Gaming, it's estimated that 2-3 percent of people who gamble at casinos develop a pathological gambling addiction. That's up to 660,000 people in the United States alone! Pathological gamblers account for about 75 percent of casino losses.

3) Bankruptcy: Gamble away enough money and you can easily find yourself bankrupted. Financial counsellors report that a high percentage of their clients who file bankruptcy do so because of gambling debts.

4) Broken Families: Gambling addictions can tear families apart. Spouses and children of problem gamblers often suffer from depression, anxiety and other psychological problems. They may also have to cope with financial insecurity if their loved one loses all their money gambling.

5) Taxpayer Costs: The social costs of gambling add up to billions of dollars a year. This includes money lost by pathological and problem gamblers, as well as costs associated with crime, bankruptcy and broken families
