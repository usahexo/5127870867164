#  Mavericks Finally Land Coveted Superstar in DeAndre Jordan

The Dallas Mavericks have been on the hunt for a superstar since their championship in 2011. Dirk Nowitzki is 37 years old and coming to the end of his illustrious career, and the Mavericks have not been able to find a player to take his place. This offseason, they finally got their man, signing DeAndre Jordan away from the Los Angeles Clippers.

Jordan is one of the most dominant big men in the NBA. He is a tenacious rebounder and shot blocker, and he can also score in the paint. With Jordan in the lineup, the Mavericks will be one of the top teams in the Western Conference. They made it to the playoffs last year with Nowitzki playing at an All-Star level, and they will only be better this year with Jordan leading them.

The Clippers had no chance of keeping Jordan after he reneged on his verbal agreement to stay with them. The team was built around him, and they are now in rebuilding mode. The Mavericks were able to sign him by offering him a four-year deal worth $80 million.

Jordan’s signing marks a turning point for the Mavericks. They are now a legitimate contender again, and they should be a team that other teams fear in the postseason.

#  What Does Indeed -110 Mean in Sports Betting?

In sports betting, a minus sign preceding a number indicates the wager is a favorite. In our example (-110), the sportsbook is indicating that it would take a $110 wager to win $100 on this selection. So in order for you to win, the favorite would have to win by more than 10 points.

A positive number preceding a selection means the bettor is taking the underdog and will win more money if they upset the favored team. For example, in a matchup of Team A -200 against Team B +150, it would take a $200 wager on Team A to win just $100. However, if you wagered on Team B and they pulled off the upset, your return on investment would be 150 percent ($100/$66).

#  How to Win at Sports Betting: Understanding Odds

When betting on sports, it’s important to understand the different odds that are being offered. This guide will teach you how to read and interpret sports betting odds so that you can make smarter bets and increase your chances of winning.

#Understanding Betting Odds

Odds are a way to measure the potential winnings for a given bet. They are expressed as a fraction, with the first number representing the amount you would win if you bet $100, and the second number representing the amount you would win if you bet $1. So, for example, 3/2 odds would mean that you would win $150 if you bet $100, and $3 if you bet $1.

The following are some of the most common types of odds:

-Straight Up: This is when you bet on a team or player to win outright, without any point spread involved. The odds are displayed as a simple number (e.g. 1/1, 2/1, etc).

-Point Spread: This is when you bet on a team or player to cover a set point spread. The point spread is usually expressed in terms of points (e.g. -6, +7, etc). In order to win a point spread wager, your team or player must either win by more points than the spread or lose by fewer points than the spread. If they end up tying the game, then it’s considered a “push” and your original stake is refunded.

-Money Line: This is when you bet on a team or player to win straight up, with no point spread involved. The money line is displayed as either positive or negative numbers (e.g. +125, -200, etc). To figure out how much you would stand to win on a money line wager, simply multiply your stake by the money line odds. So for example, if you wagered $100 on Team A to win at +125 odds and they ended up winning, then you would receive $125 back plus your initial $100 stake for a total profit of $225.

#  Mavericks Jolt NBA with Massive Signing of DeAndre Jordan

In a stunning turn of events, the Mavericks pulled off the signing of DeAndre Jordan late Wednesday night, shocking the NBA world.

Jordan had been expected to re-sign with the Clippers, but after a lengthy meeting with Mavericks owner Mark Cuban on Wednesday night, he decided to sign with Dallas instead.

"I'm excited about this opportunity to join the Mavericks and play alongside Dirk Nowitzki," Jordan said in a statement. "I'm also grateful for the chance to be reunited with Rick Carlisle and my old teammates from LA."

Jordan's signing is a major coup for the Mavericks, who have now added arguably the best center in the league to a team that already includes Dirk Nowitzki and Chandler Parsons.

"DeAndre is one of the best players at his position in the NBA," Cuban said in a statement. "He's an impact player and difference-maker, and we're thrilled to have him join our team."

The move comes as a major surprise given that Jordan had been expected to re-sign with the Clippers, and it remains unclear what led him to change his mind at the last minute.

The Clippers are reportedly "blindsided" by Jordan's decision and are currently exploring their options. They could try to sign another center in free agency or use their available cap space to pursue another player in trade.

#  Are the Dallas Mavericks a Good Bet This Season?

The Dallas Mavericks had a disappointing 2017-2018 season, finishing with a 24-58 record. This was only good enough for 13th in the Western Conference and a lottery pick in the upcoming NBA draft. Many are wondering if the Mavericks are a good bet to improve this season.

There are several factors that suggest the Mavericks may struggle again this season. For starters, Dirk Nowitzki has announced that he is retiring at the end of this season, so the Mavericks will have to find a new go-to scorer. They also lost their top player last season when Luka Doncic was traded to the Atlanta Hawks as part of a package for Trae Young. Finally, they have not made any major offseason signings and appear to be focusing on rebuilding through the draft.

Despite these factors, there is still some reason for optimism about the Mavericks this season. They should have a solid starting lineup with Harrison Barnes, Wesley Matthews, DeAndre Jordan, Jalen Brunson and Dorian Finney-Smith. And while they may not have any superstars on their roster, they do have some good young players who could develop into stars in Doncic andYoung.

In conclusion, it is difficult to say whether or not the Mavericks will be a good bet this season. There are both positive and negative signs pointing in different directions. However, there is some potential for them to improve this year and so they could be worth taking a chance on
