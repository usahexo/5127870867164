#  Get the Perfect 3D Position Machine Cake Baccarat Butterfly Every Time!

In this article, we will explore how to get the perfect 3D position machine cake baccarat butterfly every time.

To start, you will need the following supplies:

1 cake pan

1 9"x13" baking sheet

non-stick cooking spray

1 package white cake mix

2 cups milk

electric mixer
 often called a "stand mixer" with a paddle attachment (or use a hand mixer) 
3 large eggs whites at room temperature, divided into yolks and whites (reserve the yolks for later in the recipe) 
vanilla extract or other flavoring extract, as desired* 
11 ounces (by weight) almond paste (not marzipan) 

Now that you have gathered your supplies, lets start making the cake! Preheat oven 325 degrees F. Spray the bottom and sides of two pans - one 9" round and one 13"x9" with non-stick cooking spray. Dust with flour and tap out any excess. Mix cake according to package directions adding 2 tablespoons of milk to recipe. Beat on low speed for 30 seconds then beat on medium speed for 2 minutes. scrape bowl. Add 1/4 teaspoon extract, if desired, and eggs whites; beat on medium speed for 2 minutes more scraping bowl well. Divide batter evenly between pans. Bake round 9" pan 28 to 30 minutes; rectangular 13x9 inch pan 25 to 27 minutes or until toothpick inserted into center comes out clean. Cool cakes 10 minutes in pans then remove to wire racks cool completely about 1 hour. Almond paste should be 11 ounces by weight before measuring. I always make a little more than needed because it's really hard to find almond paste pre-packaged in stores around here.(you can also order it online). Take out your stand mixer or if using a hand mixer put it on the highest speed you can muster (Karen recommends using a Kitchen Aid stand mixer if you have one- I used my mothers hand mixer which was pretty old). If using a hand mixer, BE SURE TO USE A LARGE BOWL!! Cut almond paste into small pieces- about 1/2 inch cubes and add to mixer bowl.(If your almond paste is not in a cylinder form like mine was- just break it up as best as you can). Start mixer slowly and increase speed gradually until mixture becomes smooth(ish), about 5 minutes. If mixture becomes too thick add 1 tablespoon of milk at a time until desired consistency is reached. Assembly time! With wax paper layering the two cakes helps keep them from sticking together while frosting.(You will flip Cake later so don't worry about crumbs showing up on frosting) Frost top of 9" round layer with 1/2 cup of frosting.(I used an offset spatula which worked really well). Using offset spatula place 13x9 inch layer on top of 9 inch round layer bottom side down so crumbs are facing frosting.(Be sure not to press down too much when doing this or your layers will become one big mess). Frost top and sides of 13x9 inch layer with remaining frosting . Make lines across cake using offset spatula at 1 inch intervals . This makes the beautiful marbleized look . Now take reserved egg yolks and add enough sugar to make 2 tablespoons.(I used organic cane sugar but any kind will work). Using fork mix together well then add vanilla extract . Drizzle over cake letting it run down sides . Store refrigerated airtight up to 5 days . Enjoy !!

#  No More Guessing How to Make a 3D Position Machine Cake Baccarat Butterfly!

Making a cake is an art form. It can be as simple or as difficult as you want it to be. When it comes to 3D cakes, there are so many more possibilities for creation and decoration. However, getting the positioning just right can be a daunting task. But with this guide, you'll be able to make a fantastic 3D position machine cake baccarat butterfly without any guesswork!

To start, you'll need two cake boards that are the same size. Place one board down on your work surface and then place the other board on top of it so that they are both facing up. Trace around the outside of the top board with a sharp knife or toothpick. This will create your template for cutting out the cake.

Next, you'll need to make your cake batter. Be sure to follow the recipe closely so that your cake is the correct size and shape. Pour the batter into the center of the traced outline and spread it out evenly with a spatula. Make sure that the batter goes all the way to the edges of both boards.

Bake the cake according to the recipe instructions and then allow it to cool completely. Once it's cooled, use a serrated knife to cut away the excess cake around the outside of the traced outline. You may need to do this in several thin layers, depending on how thick your cake is. If you have trouble cutting through the cake, try dipping your knife in hot water before slicing each piece off.

Now it's time to assemble your 3D position machine cake baccarat butterfly! Carefully remove one of the boards from below the cake and set it aside. Flip over the second board so that it is now facing down on top of the cake. Gently press down on top of the board so that it makes an indentation in the top of the cake. This will be your guide for adding decorations later on.

Repeat this process with as many boards as you like to create different sections on your butterfly cake. Be sure to leave at least 1/2-inch between each board so that there is room for frosting and decorations later on.

Once you have finished assembling your butterfly, it's time to frost it! Use a thick layer of frosting all over top of your cake, making sure to fill in any gaps between boards with extra frosting. Now is also a good time to add any final decorations, such as sprinkles or edible flowers.

And there you have it! Your very own 3D position machine cake baccarat butterfly!
