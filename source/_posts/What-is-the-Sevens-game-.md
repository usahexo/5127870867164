#  What is the Sevens game? 

The Sevens game is a form of rugby that is played with seven players on each side, as opposed to the traditional fifteen-a-side format. Rugby Sevens is growing in popularity all over the world, and the International Rugby Board (IRB) has even designated it as an official Olympic sport starting from the 2016 Rio Games.

The Sevens game was first developed back in 1883 by the students of the Melrose Academy in Scotland. It was designed as a way to make rugby more exciting and faster-paced, and soon caught on among other schools and clubs. The first international match was played in 1891 between England and Wales.

The Sevens game gained even more popularity after it was adopted as an event at the Commonwealth Games in 1998. The inaugural tournament was won by New Zealand, who have since dominated the competition. The IRB then took over the running of the event, and since then it has been held at every subsequent Commonwealth Games.

Rugby Sevens made its debut at the Olympics in 2016, and was again dominated by New Zealand who won their third consecutive gold medal. The USA claimed silver while Fiji took home the bronze medal. 

The basic rules of Rugby Sevens are very similar to those of traditional rugby Union. However, there are some key differences: 
- There are only seven players on each side instead of fifteen. 
- The game is played over two halves of seven minutes each, instead of forty minutes. 
- Matches are typically shorter and quicker-paced than traditional Union matches . 
- Scoring is also different - tries are worth five points instead of four, while conversions are worth two points instead of three. 

Rugby Sevens is a great sport for people of all ages and abilities because it is fast paced and easy to learn. It is especially popular with younger audiences who want a more excitement-filled version of rugby than what Union can offer. And with its inclusion in the Olympics, there is sure to be even more interest in this up-and-coming sport worldwide!

#  Who invented the Sevens game? 

The game of Sevens was originally devised by a man named John Lowe in the early 19th century. Lowe was an Englishman who is credited with being the first person to formalize the game and put in place the basic rules and structure. 

Prior to Lowe's invention, Sevens was played informally by people all over England. But it wasn't until Lowe set down specific rules and created a governing body for the sport that it began to be taken seriously. 

Since then, Sevens has become one of the most popular sports in the world, with tournaments taking place all over the globe. The game is especially popular in countries like Scotland, Australia, and New Zealand, where it is often considered a national pastime.

#  How is the Sevens game played? 
The Sevens game is a fast paced, shorter form of Rugby Union. It is generally played by teams of 7 players, instead of the 15 players that are used in traditional Rugby Union. The aim of the game is to score more points than your opponent by grounding the ball in their end zone, or by kicking it through goal posts. 

There are a number of ways to score points in Sevens. You can ground the ball by running with it towards the opponents' end zone and touching it down, or you can pass it to a team mate who then scores a try. If you're feeling adventurous, you can also attempt to kick the ball through the goal posts for 3 points. 

The game is played over two 7-minute halves, with a 2-minute break in between. This makes for an action-packed game that is over in a matter of minutes!

#  What are the Sevens game rules? 

Created in 1875, Sevens (also known as Rugby sevens) is a variant of rugby union in which teams are composed of only seven players, instead of the usual 15. The game is faster-paced, and is considered a more exciting form of the sport.

Sevens follows the same rules as traditional rugby union with a few exceptions:
1. There are only seven players on each team.
2. Matches are shorter, typically lasting around 20 minutes.
3. A try is worth five points, rather than the traditional six.
4. Conversion kicks after a try are worth two points, rather than three.
5. In general, play is more fast-paced and wide-open than in traditional rugby union matches.

#  What are the benefits of playing the Sevens game?

There are many benefits of playing the Sevens game. First and foremost, Sevens is an excellent way to improve fitness and stamina. The fast-paced nature of the game means players are constantly on the move, running and dodging opponents. Additionally, because the game is played over a shorter period of time than traditional rugby, players must be efficient with their energy, making them stronger both physically and mentally.

Perhaps most importantly, Sevens is just a lot of fun! The physicality and excitement of the game make it an enjoyable experience for participants and spectators alike. Whether youâ€™re a beginner or experienced player, Sevens is a great way to spend your time.
