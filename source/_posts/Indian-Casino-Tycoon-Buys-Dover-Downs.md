#  Indian Casino Tycoon Buys Dover Downs

An Indian casino tycoon has agreed to purchase Dover Downs Gaming and Entertainment for $1.3 billion. The move would give the owner of three major casinos in the eastern United States a foothold in the Mid-Atlantic gaming market.

The agreement, announced Monday, comes as states are increasingly legalizing gambling, including sports betting, as a way to generate revenue.

Dover Downs operates a casino and harness racing track in Delaware and another casino in Maryland.

The deal is expected to close by the end of the year.

Dover Downs is a small but profitable casino and horse-racing track in Delaware with annual revenue of about $300 million. The company was taken private in 2006 in a leveraged buyout by private equity firms Apollo Global Management and Oaktree Capital Management.

The deal is still subject to regulatory approval, but is expected to close by the end of the year.

The deal is expected to close in early December. It still needs the approval of the Dover Downs shareholders and gaming regulators.

Dover Downs Hotel & Casino is a casino and hotel located in Dover, Delaware. It is owned by Dover Downs Gaming & Entertainment, which also owns the Harrington Raceway & Casino located in Harrington, Delaware. The casino has 161,000 square feet (15,000 m2) of gaming space, with 2,500 slot machines, 63 table games, and a poker room. The attached hotel has 304 rooms.

A Japanese gaming company has agreed to take over Dover Downs, one of the oldest and largest casinos in the United States. The acquisition is worth $1.7 billion and will give the Japanese company a foothold in the American gambling market.

Dover Downs is a massive casino, hotel, and racetrack complex located in Dover, Delaware. It has been in operation since the 1970s and is one of the most popular gambling destinations on the East Coast. The casino features over 2,000 slot machines and 100 table games, as well as a large hotel and racing facility.

The Japanese gaming company that is taking over Dover Downs is called Sega Sammy Holdings. It is one of the largest gaming companies in Japan, with revenues of over $4 billion. The company operates a number of casinos and other gambling facilities in Japan and has been eager to expand into the American market.

The takeover of Dover Downs is just the latest sign that the American gambling market is heating up.
