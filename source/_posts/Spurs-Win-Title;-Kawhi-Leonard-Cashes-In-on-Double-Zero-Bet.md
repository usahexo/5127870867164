#  Spurs Win Title; Kawhi Leonard Cashes In on Double Zero Bet

The San Antonio Spurs won their fifth championship on Sunday night, defeating the Miami Heat four games to one. Kawhi Leonard was named Finals MVP after averaging 17.8 points and 6.4 rebounds per game.

Leonard, who was drafted by the Spurs with the fifteenth overall pick in the 2011 NBA Draft, had an opportunity to make some serious money before the start of the playoffs. If San Antonio were to win the championship, Leonard would have earned a $200,000 bonus for each of his first three seasons with the team.

However, there was a catch. If San Antonio lost in any round of the playoffs, Leonard would have had to pay then-head coach Gregg Popovich $2,000.

Fortunately for Leonard, he doesn't have to worry about that now. He is set to earn a new contract that will pay him an average of $16 million per season.

The Spurs first title came in 1999, when they defeated the New York Knicks four games to one in the Finals. San Antonio would go on to win titles in 2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014. The last two titles were captured against LeBron James and the Miami Heat.

#  LeBron James Fails to Cash in on Double Zero Bet

LeBron James made a bold bet prior to the start of the 2017-2018 NBA season. He wagered that he would score at least 10,000 points and grab at least 7,000 rebounds during the course of the season. With just a few games left in the regular season, it’s now or never for LeBron to make good on his bet.

So far this season, LeBron has scored 9,744 points and grabbed 6,888 rebounds. That means he needs just 256 points and 112 rebounds over the next three games to cash in on his bet. However, it is not going to be easy. The Cavaliers are currently locked in a battle for playoff positioning and they need LeBron to play at his best down the stretch.

Can LeBron James hit the 10,000 point / 7,000 rebound mark? Only time will tell. But one thing is for sure – if he does achieve this milestone, he will be one of the very few players in NBA history to do so.

#  Celtics' Win Sets NBA Record; Isaiah Thomas Cashes In on Double Zero Bet

It was a banner night at the TD Garden as the Boston Celtics topped the Milwaukee Bucks, 112-99. Not only did the Celtics win their eighteenth consecutive game and set an NBA record in the process, but Isaiah Thomas also cashed in on a $0.00 bet he made with teammate Jae Crowder before the game.

"I told Jae that I was going to get a double-double tonight and he didn't believe me," said Thomas. "So I put $0.00 on it and won."

The 5'9" point guard finished with 24 points and 10 assists, helping the Celtics improve to 33-10 on the season. They now hold a two-and-a-half-game lead over the Washington Wizards for first place in the Eastern Conference.

"We're playing great basketball right now," said Crowder. "But we know that we can get even better."

The Celtics will look to extend their winning streak when they take on the Utah Jazz on Friday night.

#  Warriors Dominate Playoffs Again; Stephen Curry Cashes In on Double Zero Bet

The Golden State Warriors steamrolled their opponents in the 2017 playoffs, led once again by unanimous MVP Stephen Curry. Curry had some of his most memorable moments during the postseason run, including a game-winning overtime 3-pointer against the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Western Conference Finals and a 38-point outburst in Game 2 of the NBA Finals against the Cleveland Cavaliers.

But it was the Curry's "double zero" bet that generated the most buzz leading up to and during the playoffs. Last December, Curry made a friendly wager with teammate Andre Iguodala on who would score more points in 2017 between the two players. The loser of the bet would have to pay for dinner at an expensive restaurant.

Curry's early season struggles led many to believe that Iguodala would be dining on lobster and steak while Curry paid for dessert. But a late-season surge, including another unanimous MVP award, propelled Curry to victory and cost Iguodala a nice night out on the town.

#  Cavaliers Suffer Another Early Playoff Exit; Kyrie Irving Cashes in on Double Zero Bet

There was a lot of hype leading up to the 2017 NBA Playoffs. The Cleveland Cavaliers were the top seed in the Eastern Conference and were heavily favored to make it to the Finals for the fourth consecutive year. However, they were eliminated in five games by the Boston Celtics, who were led by Kyrie Irving – LeBron James’ former teammate.

It was a disappointing end for the Cavaliers, but there was some good news to come out of it. Irving had an excellent series against his former team, averaging 24 points and 7 assists per game while shooting over 50% from the field. He also cashed in on a $0 bet he made with teammate Tristan Thompson before the playoffs began.

Thompson had wagered that Irving would average at least 24 points per game in the playoffs. Irving met that requirement and then some, so Thompson had to pay up. Irving was more than happy to take his winnings in cash, and he plans to use it to buy a new car.

The Celtics will now face the Golden State Warriors in the Eastern Conference Finals. While they are major underdogs, they have shown that they are capable of playing with anyone when their backs are against the wall.
