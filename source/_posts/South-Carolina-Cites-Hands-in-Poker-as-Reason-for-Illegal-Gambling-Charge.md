#  South Carolina Cites Hands in Poker as Reason for Illegal Gambling Charge

In a recent case in South Carolina, law enforcement officials charged a man with illegal gambling after citing his hands as the reason for their decision. The defendant, who was not identified by name in the report, was playing poker with friends when he was arrested.

According to the police report, officers observed the defendant throwing a pair of jacks - a common starting hand in poker - and determined that this was evidence of illegal gambling. They then arrested the defendant and charged him with violating state law.

This story has generated a great deal of discussion on social media, with many people questioning both the legality of poker and the reasoning of the police department. Some commenters have noted that simply throwing a pair of jacks does not constitute evidence of gambling, particularly since many other cards can also be considered strong hands in poker.

Others have argued that poker is a game of skill rather than chance, and thus should not be considered illegal gambling under South Carolina law. It is unclear what the outcome of this case will be or whether it will set any precedent for future cases involving poker or other casino games.

#  South Carolina Seeks to Clarify What Constitutes a 'Hand' in Poker 
Last week, the state of South Carolina released a statement seeking to clarify the definition of what constitutes a 'hand' in poker. The clarification came in response to a recent ruling by the state's Supreme Court that struck down a law prohibiting poker, ruling that the game is a skill-based contest and not a form of gambling.

The state's Gaming Commission has now released new regulations that define a hand as "a collection of five cards." This clarification is important, as it allows for the regulation of poker tournaments and other gaming activities in the state. It is also hoped that the new regulations will help to prevent disputes between players over contested hands.

#  Prosecutor: South Carolina Man Had 10 Hands in Poker 

Prosecutors argued on Wednesday that a South Carolina man had 10 hands in a poker game, and as a result, he should be convicted of cheating.

The man, who has not been identified, is said to have played cards with nine people at a home in Greenwood County in November 2016. He was accused of using three different hands to play cards, which gave him an unfair advantage.

After watching footage from the game captured on a security camera, prosecutors argued that the man could be clearly seen using all three hands to play cards. They added that he had won $120 from the game and that his cheating was "obvious and blatant."

The man's defense attorney countered by saying that prosecutors were making assumptions about what could be seen in the footage. He added that there was no evidence to suggest that his client had used more than two hands during the game.

A judge is expected to deliver a verdict in the case in the coming weeks.

#  South Carolina DEFINES A HAND IN POKER: 5 CARD STUD, TWO PAIR, ETC 

Each state has its own set of laws governing gambling, and poker is no exception. In South Carolina, the definition of a hand in poker is set out in statute, and it's a bit more complicated than in some other states.

In South Carolina, the five-card stud hand rankings are used to determine the winning hand. Aces are high and 2s are low. In other words, the best possible hand is 5-4-3-2-A (a royal flush). The second best hand is 4-3-2-A-K (a straight flush), followed by 4-4-3-2 (a full house).

There are a few special hands that are defined in South Carolina law. These include:

* Two pair - two cards of one rank, two cards of another rank
* Three of a kind - three cards of the same rank
* Straight - five consecutive cards of any suit
* Flush - five cards of the same suit, not consecutive
* Full house - three cards of one rank, two cards of another rank
* Four of a kind - four cards of the same rank
* Royal flush - Ace, King, Queen, Jack, 10 all of the same suit

#  S.C. Court Rules That Region's Definition of a Hand in Poker is Improper

The Fourth Circuit of the United States Court of Appeals recently released a decision that the definition of what constitutes a “hand” in poker is improper. This ruling comes as a result of two separate cases being heard by the court, one from North Carolina and one from West Virginia.

In both cases, the defendants were charged with violating state gambling statutes by participating in illegal poker games. The defendants argued that the state’s definitions of a hand in poker were too vague and that, as a result, they could not be convicted.

The appellate court agreed with the defendants, stating that “because the term ‘hand’ is not defined in any of the governing statutes, it cannot be objectively determined what conduct violates those provisions.” The court went on to say that “the lack of an express definition leaves uncertainty as to what is prohibited and invites arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement.”

This decision strikes down decades-old definitions of a hand in poker that have been used by many states to prosecute players. It represents a victory for players across the country and should help to clarify the law with regards to poker games.
