Mills Five Cent QT slot machines are classic mechanical devices that were popular in the early 1900s. These machines have a unique look and feel that makes them a popular choice for collectors and enthusiasts. However, if you want to restore or repair your Mills Five Cent QT slot machine, you may need to remove the cover. Here are the steps to follow:

## Step 1: Unplug the Machine

Before you begin, make sure the machine is turned off and unplugged. This will ensure your safety and prevent any electrical accidents.

## Step 2: Remove the Lock and Key

Next, locate the lock and key on the front of the machine. Use the key to unlock the machine and remove the lock. This will allow you to open the front panel.

## Step 3: Open the Front Panel

Once the lock is removed, gently pull the front panel of the machine open. Be careful not to force it, as this can cause damage to the machine.

## Step 4: Remove the Back Cover

Now that the front panel is open, you can access the back cover of the machine. Locate the screws or bolts that hold the back cover in place, and use a screwdriver or wrench to remove them.

## Step 5: Remove the Cover

With the screws or bolts removed, you can now lift off the back cover of the machine. Be careful not to damage any wires or components inside the machine as you remove the cover.

## Step 6: Clean and Inspect

Once the cover is removed, you can clean and inspect the inside of the machine. This is a good opportunity to check for any damage or wear that may need to be repaired.

## Step 7: Reassemble the Machine

After you have finished cleaning and inspecting the machine, it is time to reassemble it. Replace the back cover, and tighten the screws or bolts to secure it in place. Then, close the front panel of the machine, and lock it using the key.

By following these steps, you can easily remove the cover from your Mills Five Cent QT slot machine.
