#  Bettors forecast major upset in college basketball tournament

The NCAA Men’s Basketball Tournament is one of the most popular sporting events in the United States. College basketball fans from all over the country fill out brackets in the hope of predicting the tournament’s outcome. However, this year’s tournament is expected to feature a major upset, as no top seed is favored to win the championship.

Bettors are favoring No. 3 seed Michigan State to win the tournament, with odds of 7-1. Michigan State advanced to the Final Four last year before losing to eventual champion Villanova. Other teams with favorable odds include No. 2 seed Duke (10-1), No. 1 seed Kansas (12-1), and No. 4 seed Gonzaga (14-1).

One team that is not expected to make it very far is defending champion North Carolina. The Tar Heels are currently ranked No. 6 in the country, but they are only listed as a 25-1 long shot to win it all. Other teams that are not expected to do well include No. 5 seed Kentucky (30-1) and No. 7 seed Maryland (40-1).

While no top seed is favored to win the tournament, there is still a lot of basketball left to be played. Anything can happen in March, so don’t be surprised if one of the lower seeds pulls off an upset and walks away with the National Championship trophy.

#  3/1 odds for gambling could pay off big this weekend

There's something about the start of a new month that just feels right for gambling. Maybe it's the fresh, clean slate or the promise of new beginnings, but whatever it is, March offers some of the best betting odds around. This weekend in particular, 3/1 odds could pay off big time if you know where to look.

Sports betting is always more fun when there's something at stake, and with the NCAA tournament starting up, there are plenty of opportunities for upsets and long shots. So whether you're looking to place a few bets on your favorite team or go all in on an underdog, this weekend offers plenty of potential payoff.

Just be careful not to get too carried away. Gambling can be addictive, and it's important to remember that no matter how good your luck might be this weekend, it's always important to set limits and know when to walk away. With that in mind, here are a few tips for gambling this weekend:

* Do your research . Before you put any money down on a game, make sure you know as much as possible about both teams. What's their recent history? Who are the key players? What are the odds? Arm yourself with as much information as possible so you can make informed decisions about where to put your money.

* Pick your spots . Not every game is worth betting on - especially when the odds are so stacked against you. Save your money for games that offer better potential payoffs and avoid putting too much at risk on a single bet.

* Have fun ! Gambling should be enjoyable - after all, what's the point if it's not at least a little bit exciting? So relax and enjoy yourself while still being smart about how much money you're risking.

#  Odds for gambling on the NCAA tournament just got a lot more interesting

The NCAA tournament is a time when bracket pools are all the rage, as people try to correctly pick the winner of each game in order to win big bucks. But what about gambling on the games themselves? The odds for that have just gotten a lot more interesting.

The fact of the matter is that, no matter how many teams are in the tournament, there is always at least one extremely long shot. That team is usually given odds of anywhere from 50-1 to 100-1 (or even higher), and almost no one ever bets on it. But this year, there may be some value in betting on those long shots.

The reason for this is that there are several teams in this year's tournament that are considered by most experts to be either overrated or simply not very good. As a result, their odds of winning the whole thing are much longer than they would normally be. So if you're looking to make a little bit of money off the tournament, these long shot teams are your best bet.

One team that fits this description is Oklahoma State. They were given odds of 50-1 to win the tournament by most sportsbooks, but they shouldn't be counted out just yet. They were able to reach the Final Four last year, and they still have plenty of talent on their roster this year. So don't be surprised if they make a run deep into the tournament this year.

Another team with long odds is Rhode Island. They were given 66-1 odds by most sportsbooks, and they definitely don't have the same level of talent as some of the other teams in the field. But they did manage to win their conference tournament, and they could definitely pull off an upset or two in the NCAA tournament.

So if you're looking for some value in this year's NCAA tournament, look no further than the long shot teams. You may not end up winning a lot of money, but you'll at least have some fun watching them play.

#  Don't bet against the field at 3/1 odds for gambling on the NCAA tournament

Kansas was a lock to win the NCAA tournament in the eyes of Las Vegas odds makers at the beginning of the season. A month ago, their odds were 4/7, meaning you would have to wager $7 on Kansas to earn just $4 back if they won the title.

Now, after a series of unexpected losses, Kansas' odds have lengthened to 3/1, meaning your potential payout for betting on them is only $3 for every $1 you put down.

This change means that, if you're looking to gamble on this year's NCAA tournament, it may be wiser to look elsewhere than putting your money on Kansas. A number of teams - including Michigan State (11/2), Duke (7/1), and Virginia (8/1) - offer better odds than the Jayhawks right now.

In the coming weeks, sportsbooks will continue to update their odds in response to how teams look as they head into the Big Dance. Keep an eye on these lines as you make your picks - it could pay off in the long run!

#  March Madness gambling: 3/1 odds for an underdog to win

This year’s NCAA Men’s Division I Basketball Championship is more unpredictable than ever. With no clear-cut favorite, many bettors are looking to place their bets on an underdog.

According to Oddschecker, the 3/1 odds for an underdog to win are currently the most popular bet in the tournament. This means that if you bet $100 on an underdog, you would win $300 if they pulled off the upset.

So, which underdog should you put your money on? Here are three teams with the best chances of winning it all:

#1 Loyola University Chicago Ramblers

The Ramblers are having a Cinderella season, and they’re not done yet. They have already beaten some of the top teams in the country, including Florida and Nevada. And they have a real shot at winning it all, especially since they’re a No. 11 seed.

#2 Syracuse Orange

Syracuse is another team that has been surprise this year. Despite being a No. 11 seed, they have made it all the way to the Sweet 16. And with players like Tyus Battle and Oshae Brissett, they could easily pull off another upset or two.

#3 Texas Tech Red Raiders

The Red Raiders are one of the most underrated teams in this year’s tournament. Led by head coach Chris Beard, they have been on a tear lately and are poised to make a run in March Madness.
