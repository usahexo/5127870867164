#  Poker Who Wins Over $368,000 in One Night

On the night of July 23, 2019, 25-year-old poker player Elior Sion won $368,125 from a single high roller cash game in Las Vegas. This was his biggest score to date, more than tripling his previous career earnings.

A former online poker professional who now mainly plays live tournaments, Sion is originally from France but now resides in Los Angeles. He entered the record books as the latest high roller champion at the Aria Resort and Casino.

The Aria has been a hot spot for big poker games in recent years. In June 2019, Fedor Holz took home $1.5 million from a $25,000 buy-in event there. And in January 2019, Doug Polk won $3.7 million from a $25,000 buy-in game.

Sion outlasted a field of 104 entrants in the Aria’s “King of The Hill” event to win the top prize of $368,125. The tournament was played over two days with the final table reached on Day 2. At that final table, Sion defeated Michael Mizrachi heads up to take down the title and first prize money.

This was Sion’s biggest career score by far and puts him in excellent position to challenge for more top prizes in future high roller events.

#  Poker becomes Oklahoma's first millionaire

In a game that lasted less than an hour, poker prodigy and Oklahoma native John Cynn became the first millionaire in the state's history.

The record-setting victory came at the World Series of Poker (WSOP) in Las Vegas on Sunday. Cynn, who grew up in Allen, just south of Oklahoma City, bested 8,569 other players to take home the top prize of $8.8 million.

"I'm still kind of in shock," Cynn said after his win. "It doesn't feel real."

Cynn's meteoric rise to poker stardom began just six years ago when he started playing the game online for fun. He soon discovered he had a knack for it and began playing in live tournaments, eventually qualifying for the WSOP.

In last year's Main Event, Cynn finished in 112th place, earning more than $70,000. This year, he outlasted some of the most successful poker players in the world, including chip leader Tony Miles, who finished in second place.

"John is one of those rare guys who is actually better than his results show," said Miles after the final table was set. "He has a lot of talent."

When his name was called as the champion on Sunday night, Cynn could hardly believe it himself.

"I was shaking so badly I couldn't even hold my cards," he recalled. "I thought there's no way this is happening."

Now that Cynn is a millionaire, he says he plans to invest most of his winnings and take some time off to enjoy life with his friends and family. But don't expect him to retire from poker anytime soon – with over $10 million in career earnings already under his belt, Cynn has plenty to play for.

#  Poker player wins biggest pot in history

A professional poker player has won what is being called the biggest pot in history. The unidentified player was taking part in a high stakes cash game when they scooped up the staggering $24.8 million pot.

The hand began with the player being dealt pocket kings, which they raised preflop. Two other players called, and the flop came down 9♥ 6♦ 3♠. The first player bet, and both of their opponents folded. The pot contained $9.6 million at this point.

The turn was the 5♦, and the first player checked. The second player then bet $2 million, which was enough to put the other two players all-in. The first player quickly folded, but the second player called with A♥ J♣ for top pair.

The river was the 4♣, making two pair for the second player and giving them the massive pot. It's not clear what the second player did with their winnings, but it's safe to say that they'll be enjoying life a little bit more for a while!

#  $368,000 poker win smashes state record

On Saturday night, a 36-year-old poker player from the Springfield area won more than $368,000 in a single hand of poker at the Ameristar Casino in East Chicago, Indiana, setting a new state record.

According to casino officials, the player — who has chosen to remain anonymous — was playing in a $1/$2 no-limit Texas hold’em game when he won the hand. The previous state record was set in May 2015, when a player at the Rivers Casino in Pittsburgh took home more than $326,000.

Casino spokesperson Tony Hulse said that the Springfield player had been making successful bets throughout the evening and had built up a large chip lead before finally winning the hand.

“He had been doing well all night and had accumulated quite a few chips,” Hulse said. “Then he hit this one big hand that just catapulted him to victory. It was an amazing sight to see.”

According to Hulse, the poker player is now the proud owner of one of the largest payouts ever awarded in an Indiana casino game.

“This really is a remarkable win, one for the history books,” he said.

#  Oklahoma poker player becomes overnight millionaire

An Oklahoma poker player has become an overnight millionaire after winning a major poker tournament in Las Vegas.

The player, who has chosen to remain anonymous, won a $1 million prize in the World Series of Poker main event.

He said he plans to use the money to buy a new house and pay off his debts.

“It still hasn’t sunk in yet,” he said. “I keep thinking someone is going to wake me up and tell me it was all just a dream.”

The player, who is originally from Tulsa but now lives in Las Vegas, said he has been playing poker since he was 18 years old.

He started out playing small tournaments before gradually making his way up to bigger events.

This is the first time he has ever won a major tournament.

“I just stayed focused and tried to play my best game,” he said. “ I can’t believe it actually worked out in the end.”
