            <h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Industry-Set-to-Hit-60-Billion-by-2020"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Industry-Set-to-Hit-60-Billion-by-2020" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Industry Set to Hit $60 Billion by 2020"></a>Sports Gambling Industry Set to Hit $60 Billion by 2020</h1><p>The gambling industry is growing at a rapid pace, with recent estimates putting the value of the global industry at $51.9 billion by the end of 2017. This number is expected to grow to $60.7 billion by 2020, as both established and new markets continue to expand.</p>
<p>The growth is being fueled by a number of factors, including the legalization of gambling in new jurisdictions, the rise in mobile gaming and the increasing popularity of eSports. In addition, the development of new technologies is enabling casinos and other gambling operators to offer more innovative products and services.</p>
<p>The United States accounts for the majority of gambling revenue, with a market worth $26.3 billion in 2017. The Asian market is expected to be the fastest-growing, with a projected Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 13.8% from 2017 to 2020. This will see it reach a value of $14.5 billion by 2020.</p>
<p>The growth in sports betting is a key driver of this expansion, with betting on sports now accounting for more than 40% of all global gambling revenues. In 2010, this figure was just 27%. The legalization of sports betting in new jurisdictions has been a key driver of growth, with several countries – including Italy, Portugal and Spain – legalizing sports betting in recent years.</p>
<p>Casinos are also enjoying healthy growth, with revenue from land-based casinos expected to grow at a CAGR of 4.8% from 2017 to 2020. This will see total revenue reach $52.3 billion by 2020. Online casinos are growing even faster, with a CAGR of 11% expected from 2017 to 2020. This will see online casinos account for 20% of the global market by 2020, up from 16% in 2017.</p>
<p>The growth in the gambling industry is having a positive impact on employment levels, with an estimated 1 million people now employed in the industry globally. This number is expected to grow to 1.3 million by 2020. Major employers include operators such as Caesars Entertainment Corporation (CZR) and Las Vegas Sands Corporation (LVS), as well as suppliers such as International Game Technology PLC (IGT) and Scientific Games Corporation (SGMS).</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Giants-Bet-on-Streaming-Services"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Giants-Bet-on-Streaming-Services" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Giants Bet on Streaming Services"></a>Sports Gambling Giants Bet on Streaming Services</h1><p>The sports gambling industry is worth an estimated $150 billion per year, and it’s only going to grow as more people embrace legalized gambling. This has caught the attention of several major tech companies, each of which is jockeying for a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Most notable is Amazon, which has thrown its hat into the ring with a new service called Amazon Prime betting. This allows customers to place bets on a variety of events, including professional and collegiate sports, as well as global politics.</p>
<p>Google has also made a move into the space with its recently announced Google betting service. This will allow users to place bets on a wide range of sporting events, as well as in-game propositions such as who will score the next goal or how many points will be scored in the next quarter.</p>
<p>Apple is getting in on the action as well with its new Apple betting platform. This will allow customers to place bets on a variety of events, including traditional sports such as soccer and basketball, as well as esports and other unique events.</p>
<p>Each of these services offers a unique take on sports gambling, but they all have one thing in common: they’re all built on top of streaming services. This is no coincidence, as streaming has become the go-to platform for delivering content over the internet. It’s convenient, affordable, and widely available.</p>
<p>This presents a major opportunity for sports gambling companies. By building their platforms on top of streaming services, they can reach a massive audience of potential customers. And since streaming is increasingly becoming the primary way that people consume content, there’s a good chance that many of these customers will be regular users of these platforms.</p>
<h1 id="Sports-Gambling-Industry-on-the-Rise-as-Legalization-Spreads"><a href="#Sports-Gambling-Industry-on-the-Rise-as-Legalization-Spreads" class="headerlink" title="Sports Gambling Industry on the Rise as Legalization Spreads"></a>Sports Gambling Industry on the Rise as Legalization Spreads</h1><p>The sports gambling industry is expanding rapidly as more and more countries legalize the activity. The potential profits are huge, and sportsbooks are rushing to get a piece of the action.</p>
<p>Legalized sports gambling is currently available in a handful of countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, and Canada. But the list is growing quickly, with several other countries set to join in the near future.</p>
<p>In most cases, sports betting is offered through state-run lotteries or through licensed private operators. In some cases, such as in the United States, it is also offered through casinos and horse racing tracks.</p>
<p>Sports gambling is a huge industry, with estimated global revenue of $410 billion per year. And that number is expected to grow rapidly as more countries legalize it. In the United States alone, total revenue from sports betting is expected to reach $6.2 billion by 2023.</p>
<p>The potential profits are huge, and sportsbooks are rushing to get a piece of the action. Online bookmakers are especially aggressive in seeking new customers, with many offering sign-up bonuses and free bets worth hundreds of dollars.</p>
<p>The increased competition is good news for consumers, who now have a wide range of options when it comes to choosing a sportsbook. It’s also good news for regulators, who can now impose strict regulations on operators in order to protect consumers.</p>
<p>At the moment, there are still some dangers associated with sports gambling. Illegal bookmakers often operate without any regulation whatsoever, which can lead to fraud and other abuses. Legalizing the activity will help mitigate these risks by imposing strict rules on licensed operators.</p>
<p>Overall, the growth of legalized sports gambling is a positive development for both consumers and operators alike. As more countries legalize it, we can expect even greater profits and better protections for consumers</p>
<h1 id="The-Future-of-Gambling-legalized-sports-betting"><a href="#The-Future-of-Gambling-legalized-sports-betting" class="headerlink" title="The Future of Gambling: legalized sports betting"></a>The Future of Gambling: legalized sports betting</h1><p>Around the world, gambling is a multi-billion dollar industry. The future of gambling looks bright, with new opportunities arising in the form of legalized sports betting. This article will explore the potential benefits of legalized sports betting and how it can benefit both the gambling industry and the public.</p>
<p>It is estimated that around $81 billion is wagered on sport each year around the world. This number is expected to grow as more countries legalize sports betting. For example, in March 2018, the Indian Supreme Court ruled that sports betting is not a crime, opening up this multi-billion dollar market to legalization.</p>
<p>There are many benefits to legalizing sports betting. First, it will provide much-needed tax revenue to governments. In addition, it will create jobs in the gambling industry. Finally, it will allow bettors to wager on sporting events in a safe and secure environment.</p>
<p>Legalizing sports betting will also benefit consumers. For example, it will help combat illegal gambling operations that often charge high fees and offer poor customer service. In addition, it will allow bettors to make informed decisions about their bets, as they will have access to accurate information about the odds for each sporting event.</p>
<p>Legalized sports betting presents a huge opportunity for the gambling industry. It is estimated that the global sports betting market could be worth as much as $£24 billion by 2023. The potential for growth is tremendous and businesses that are able to capitalize on this trend will be well positioned for success.</p>
<h1 id="How-Will-NBA-NFL-React-to-Supreme-Court-Ruling-on-Sports-Betting"><a href="#How-Will-NBA-NFL-React-to-Supreme-Court-Ruling-on-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="How Will NBA, NFL React to Supreme Court Ruling on Sports Betting?"></a>How Will NBA, NFL React to Supreme Court Ruling on Sports Betting?</h1><p>The Supreme Court is hearing a case on Monday that could legalize sports betting across the United States. The case, Christie v. National Collegiate Athletic Association, centers around a law passed in 1992 that bans sports betting in all but four states.</p>
<p>If the Court decides to overturn the law, it would open up the possibility of legal sports betting in all 50 states. This would be a major victory for casinos and other businesses that stand to profit from legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>The NBA and NFL have both been lobbying against the legalization of sports betting, arguing that it would lead to corruption in their leagues. But they may wind up losing this battle, as public opinion has shifted in favor of legalizing sports gambling.</p>
<p>A recent poll by the Monmouth University Polling Institute found that 73% of Americans support legalizing sports betting. This is a significant change from 1992, when the law banning sports betting was passed.</p>
<p>So how will the NBA and NFL react if the Supreme Court strikes down the ban on sports gambling?</p>
<p>The NBA has already said that it will not try to block legalized sports gambling, but it will push for regulations to ensure that there is no corruption in the league. The NFL has been more vocal in its opposition to legalized sports gambling, but it is likely that the league will eventually adapt to the new reality.</p>
<p>Legalized sports gambling could be a major boon for the NBA and NFL, as it would provide new sources of revenue and increase fan engagement. The leagues may initially oppose legalized gambling, but they will eventually come around and embrace it.</p>
